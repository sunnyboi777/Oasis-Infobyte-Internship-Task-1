Classification of Iris flower species using machine learning.
# Iris Flower Classification

This project is the first task of my Data Science Internship at Oasis Infobyte.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify the species of an Iris flower (*Setosa*, *Versicolor*, or *Virginica*) based on four features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

## Process
1.  **Data Exploration:** Analyzed the dataset to understand feature distributions and relationships.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned the data and prepared it for model training.
3.  **Model Training:** Implemented and trained multiple classification models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
4.  **Evaluation:** The SVM model achieved 100% accuracy on the test set, successfully classifying all instances.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
